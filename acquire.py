# Make a new python module, acquire.py to hold the following data aquisition functions:


# 1.  Make a function named get_titanic_data that returns the titanic data from the codeup 
# data science database as a pandas data frame. Obtain your data from the Codeup Data 
# Science Database.





# 2. Make a function named get_iris_data that returns the data from the iris_db on the 
# codeup data science database as a pandas data frame. The returned data frame should 
# include the actual name of the species in addition to the species_ids. Obtain your 
# data from the Codeup Data Science Database.






# 3.  Once you've got your get_titanic_data and get_iris_data functions written, now 
# it's time to add caching to them. To do this, edit the beginning of the function to check 
# for a local filename like titanic.csv or iris.csv. If they exist, use the .csv file. 
# If the file doesn't exist, then produce the SQL and pandas necessary to create a dataframe, 
# then write the dataframe to a .csv file with the appropriate name.
